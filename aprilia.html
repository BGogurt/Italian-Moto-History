		  Aprilia was founded after the Second World War by 
		  Cavaliere Alberto Beggio, as a bicycle production factory at 
		  Noale, Italy in the province of Venice. Alberto’s son, Ivano Beggio,
		  took over the helm of the company in 1968 and constructed a 
		  50 cc "motorcycle" with a dozen or so collaborators. 
		  The first production Aprilia mopeds were named Colibrì, 
		  Daniela and Packi. Aprilia later produced a motocross bike in 
		  1970 called the Scarabeo. Produced until the end of the 1970s, 
		  the Scarabeo came in 50 and 125 cc versions.
          In 1977 Ivan Alborghetti from Milan, Italy won the 
		  Italian 125 and 250 cc motorcross championships on Aprilias. 
		  In 1978 Alborghetti closed the season with two third places 
		  in individual races and sixth place in the World Championship. 
		  In the 1980s Aprilia added enduro, trials and road bikes 
		  of between 50 and 600 cc. In 1981 Aprilia introduced the 
		  TL320 trials machine. In 1983 Aprilia launched to St 125 road bike.
		  In 1984 Aprilia launched an improved model called STX, and 
		  an enduro, called the ET 50.

		  In 1985, Aprilia started outsourcing 
		  engines for some models to the Austrian company Rotax. 
		  In 1985 Aprilia launched a 125 STX and 350 STX. 
		  In 1986 Aprilia launched the AF1; a small sports model, and 
		  the Tuareg; a large tanked bike for African rallies like 
		  the Dakar Rally. Aprilia factory rider Philippe Berlatier 
		  contended for the trials world championship reaching fifth place, 
		  and Loris Reggiani rode an Aprilia GP 250 with Rotax engine to 
		  sixth place in the road racing World Championship. 
		  Two seasons later, on August 30, 1987, at San Marino Grand Prix 
		  in Misano Loris Reggiani's AF1 won the first World Speed Championship.
		  In 1990 Aprilia launched the Pegaso 600, a road bike derived from
		  off-road mechanics. Later, in 1992 Aprilia rider Alessandro Gramigni 
		  won the World 125 Road Racing Championship title. Also in 1992,
		  Tommy Ahvala won the World Trials Championship on an Aprilia Climber.
		  Since then, Aprilia has 124 times won 125 and 250 cc class Grand Prix,
		  15 Road Racing World Championship titles, and 16 European 
		  speed titles. Many world champions started on Aprilia such
		  as Biaggi, Capirossi, Gramigni, Locatelli, Sakata and Rossi.
		  Also in the 1990s, Aprilia entered the scooter market starting
		  in 1990 with Italy’s first all-plastic scooter, the Amico.
		  In 1992, Aprilia introduced the Amico LK and the two stroke
		  Pegaso 125, both with catalytic converters. In 1993 Aprilia
		  launched a large diameter wheel scooter reusing the name 
		  Scarabeo with a four-stroke, four-valve engine. Later
		  Aprilia launched more scooters such as the Leonardo, 
		  the SR and the Gulliver.

		  In 1995, Aprilia commissioned
		  Philippe Starck to design the Motò which was shown in
		  New York’s Modern Art Museum. Also in 1995 Aprilia launched 
		  the two stroke RS 125 and RS 250 sports bikes. In 1998
		  Aprilia launched what is its current flagship model the
		  RSV Mille, a 1000cc V-Twin Superbike, and the Falco, a 
		  1000cc V-Twin sport tourer with emphasis on sport. Both bikes 
		  used a variation of a Rotax 1000cc engine. In 1999 Aprilia
		  entered World Superbike Championship racing with its RSV Mille, 
		  and during 2000, Aprilia acquired Moto-Guzzi and Laverda,
		  both historic heritage Italian marques. In 2000 Aprilia
		  launched the 50 cc DiTech (Direct Injection Technology)
		  two stroke engine for scooters which provides high mileage
		  and low emissions, and also the RST Futura, a sport tourer, 
		  and the ETV 1000 Caponord; an adventure touring motorcycle. 
		  Both of these latter two motorcycles used a variation of 
		  the Rotax 1000 cc V-Twin. Most recently, in 2003, 
		  Aprilia launched the RSV Mille Tuono which was essentially
		  an RSV Mille with motorcross-style high handlebars 
		  and only a small headlight fairing. Most of the major 
		  motorcycle magazines picked it for the best bike of the year. 
		  In 2004 Aprilia was acquired by Piaggio & C. SpA, 
		  to form the world’s fourth largest motorcycle group with 
		  1.5 billion Euro in sales, an annual production capacity
		  of over 600,000 vehicles, and a presence in 50 countries.
		  With the acquisition by Piaggio, the newly nominated
		  President of Aprilia is Roberto Colaninno (President of
		  Piaggio & C.), and the Managing Director is Rocco Sabelli. 
		  The founder, Ivano Beggio, is the Honorary President.
		  On 15 August 2010, Aprilia became the most successful 
		  motorcycle racing brand in history, surpassing fellow 
		  Italian MV Agusta with a record 276th victory.
