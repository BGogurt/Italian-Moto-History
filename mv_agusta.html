		Count Vincenzo and Domenico Agusta had a passion for mechanical
		workings and for motorcycle racing. Much like Enzo Ferrari, 
		they produced and sold motorcycles almost exclusively to fund
		their racing efforts. They were determined to have the best
		Grand Prix motorcycle racing team in the world and spared no
		expense on their passion. MV Agusta produced their first
		prototype, called "Vespa 98", in 1945. After learning that the 
		name had already been registered by Piaggio for its Vespa
		motorscooter, it was referred to simply by the number “98”.
		In 1948, the company built a 125 cc two-stroke single and
		entered Franco Bertoni in the Italian Grand Prix. Bertoni won
		the event held in Monza and instantly put the new motorcycle
		manufacturer on the map.In the 1949 season, the 125 cc, or 
		ultra light weight class, 
		gained new prestige. More motorcycle manufacturers were
		competing in the inaugural world championships that were held
		in Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. The Mondial 125 cc DOHC
		design dominated the 1949 season. The MV riders placed ninth 
		and tenth in the final standings. In 1950, Arturo Magni and
		Piero Remor joined the company after working with Gilera. 
		Magni was the chief mechanic and Remor was chief designer. 
		The 1950 season and 1951 season were development years, as
		the company adopted the 125 Dohc four-stroke engine. Racing 
		efforts only produced a fifth-place finish at the Dutch TT in
		1950. The 1951 results were only slightly better.

		The 1952 season saw the introduction of telescopic forks, full 
		width alloy brake hubs and a sleek fuel tank on the 125 race bike.
		Power was 15 bhp (11 kW) @ 10800 rpm. Britain's Cecil Sandford 
		piloted the new MV 125 to a 1952 Isle of Man TT victory and went
		on to win MV Agusta's first world championship.With the success
		of the 1952 season, independent or "privateer" riders could now 
		purchase a "catalog" version of the 125 DOHC, now available
		through the company. The Sport Competizione racer had many of the
		same features as the factory bike. These included a multi-plate
		clutch, gear-driven oil pump, Dell'Orto 27 mm SS1 carburetor and
		remote float chamber. The bike was nicknamed the "Boy Racer". 
		In 1953, the race engineers adopted the Earles-type forks to help
		with handling problems on the works racers. The 1953 season saw 
		the introduction of the 350 Four. MV’s racing efforts now included
		the 500 cc, 350 cc and 125 cc class.

		Nineteen fifty-three saw the introduction of a new 175 cc overhead 
		cam model. MV Agusta produced the 175 CST and CSTL (Turismo Lusso) 
		for street use and soon developed a sportier 175 cc version with 
		larger carburetor, a larger cylinder head with bigger fins, aluminum
		wheel rims and plenty of glossy red paint. The first year version
		(1954) of the 175 Sport featured a beautifully sculpted fuel tank
		that quickly earned it the unofficial nickname "Disco Volante"
		(flying saucer) as, viewed from the front, the tank shape was 
		reminiscent of a flying saucer. Soon after, MV began offering a very
		limited-availability racing version 175 cc "Super Sport" for MSDS 
		racing (production club racing) equipped with unusual Earles-design
		front forks. In 1955, it was superseded by a new and improved Super
		Sport model with radical new styling and a five-speed gearbox. 
		Its design earned it the nickname "Squalo" (Shark). This 175 cc
		racing machine was very popular in Britain in the mid 1950s, where
		tuners learned to bore it out to over 200 cc capacity. Racers
		including Micheal O’Rourke, Derek Minter, and Bob Keeler raced the
		175 and 125 Sport Competizione around Europe with a great deal of
		success. The marketing strategy of "race it on Sunday, sell it on 
		Monday" was adhered to, and it worked. MV street motorcycles enjoyed
		immense popularity throughout Europe. In 1958 American rider
		Dave Schuler, riding a borrowed and barely modified MV 175 Sport 
		street bike, won the 175 class at the famed Catalina Island GP 
		off-road race, in California.
        <br><br>
		After the 1957 season, the Italian motorcycle manufacturers Gilera,
		Moto Guzzi and Mondial jointly agreed to withdraw from Grand Prix
		competition due to escalating costs and diminishing sales. Count
		Agusta originally agreed to withdraw, but then had second thoughts.
		MV Agusta went on to dominate Grand Prix racing, winning 17 
		consecutive 500 cc world championships. Count Agusta's
		competitive nature usually saw him hire some of the best riders
		of the time, namely Carlo Ubbiali, John Surtees, Mike Hailwood, 
		Giacomo Agostini, Phil Read, among others, and having the best 
		engineers, most notably Arturo Magni. The three- and four-cylinder
		race bikes were known for their excellent road handling. The 
		fire-engine red racing machines became a hallmark of Grand Prix 
		racing in the 1960s and early 1970s.

		With the death of Count Domenico Agusta in 1971, the company lost
		its guiding force. The company won their last Grand Prix in 1976 
		and by the 1980 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season they were 
		out of racing. Shortly thereafter, they ceased motorcycle 
		production. Between 1948 and 1976 MV Agusta motorcycles had won 
		over 3000 races and 63 world championships overall. After
		MV Agusta left the racing scene in 1980, Magni began producing
		his own custom-framed MV motorcycles.

		Cagiva purchased the MV Agusta name trademarks in 1991. In 1997 
		it introduced the first new MV Agusta motorcycle. The new bikes
		were four-cylinder 750 cc sports machines, the F4 range, which 
		included a series of limited production run models, such as the 
		all black paint work SPR model (Special Production Racing) which
		was featured in the movie I, Robot. In 2004 they introduced their 
		first 1,000 cc bike. Two-thousand and four marked the end of 
		production for the 750 Sport machines, with limited production 
		of 300 SR (Special Racing) models in the traditional red and 
		silver livery.

		MV Agusta also made a limited number of F4 750 cc and F4 1,000 cc 
		Senna editions in memory of the late Formula One champion, Ayrton 
		Senna, an avid Ducati and MV Agusta collector, in aid of the 
		Instituto Ayrton Senna, his charity foundation in Brazil for
		children and young people. Three hundred of each model were made
		in the early 2000s.
        <br><br>
		They also produce a range of 750 and 910 naked bikes called the
		Brutale. Production is limited, as it is the policy of the company 
		to produce an elite machine similar to Ferrari in motor cars. 
		They do not compete directly with Japanese manufacturers, whose 
		motorcycles typically sell for considerably lower prices; rather, 
		they compete with other Italian models such as Ducati's sports bikes
		996, 998, 999, 1098, and the naked Monster. In 2005 MV Agusta 
		introduced the Tamburini 1000, which is named after its creator,
		Massimo Tamburini, who had previously worked for Ducati, where he 
		designed the Ducati 916. Cycle World and Australian Motorcycle News
		magazine named it the best sportbike in the world. Tamburini designed
		the Ducati 916 sports bike (predecessor of the 748 and 996 series)
		which marked the return of Ducati as a successful motorcycle 
		manufacturer in the early twenty-first century. The MV Agusta F4
		refined the innovative design of the 916. Claimed power of the new
		F4 312R model is 183 hp (136 kW). In 1999 the Cagiva group was 
		restructured for strategic purposes and MV Agusta become the main 
		division, comprising Cagiva and Husqvarna.

	  Heavily in debt, the manufacturer was bought by Malaysian car maker
	  Proton in December 2004 for €70 million. In December 2005 Proton sold
	  MV Agusta to GEVI SpA, a Genoa-based financing company related to
	  Carige, for a token one euro excluding debt. By 2006 GEVI SpA, with 
	  65% of the share capital, had refinanced MV Agusta, allowing the
	  company to continue, in its native Italy.
	  
		In July 2007, MV Agusta Motor SpA, sold the Husqvarna motorcycle
		brand to BMW for an undisclosed amount. According to MV Agusta
		president Claudio Castiglioni, the sale was a strategic step to 
		concentrate all of the company's resources in order to expand 
		MV Agusta and Cagiva presence in the international markets having 
		more financial resources for new model development.

		Following years of stalled ownership, the Guggenheim's "Art of 
		the Motorcycle" icon, the F4 model, was ready for a refresh, but
		the financial status of the company did not allow it. On 
		July 11, 2008, Harley-Davidson announced they had signed a
		definitive agreement to acquire the MV Agusta Group for
		US$109 million (€70m),completing the acquisition on 
		August 8, 2008.

		On October 15, 2009, Harley-Davidson announced that it would
		divest its interest in MV Agusta; on August 6, 2010,
		Harley-Davidson announced that it had concluded the sale of
		MV Agusta to Claudio Castiglioni and his wholly owned holding
		company, MV Agusta Motor Holding, S.r.l.

		MV Agusta announced that for the first three months of 2010 
		bike sales increased by 50%.

		As of 31 October 2014, Mercedes-AMG has announced a long term 
		partnership with MV Agusta and the acquisition of a 25% minority stake.
