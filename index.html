	  <p class="content">Italians have always been a leader in art and design. 
		The name that first comes to mind that emphasizes the 
		art and design of Italian history is Leonardo Da Vinci. 
		During his time he was technologically ahead of the rest of the world. 
		From the 19th century to today Italy has been one of the 
		leaders in automotive and motorcycle design. 
		Companies like Lamborghini, Ferrari, Ducati, and 
		Vespa are a few examples of this. Their beautiful 
		designs of four and two-wheeled vehicles are a testament 
		to the craftsmanship they can achieve. 
		However, this is not about what auto and Moto designs Italians can create. 
		It's about the two-wheeled machines they have already manufactured.
	    <br><br>
		The first of these creations was by a bicycle maker named Eduardo Bianchi. 
		Bianchi  made Italy's first motorcycle when he attached a motor to 
		one of his pedal powered bicycles in the late 1800's. 
		From there he delve into other areas of manufacturing including 
		airplanes, cars and other various things. Several other companies 
		followed suit in making motor powered bicycles after Bianchi's 
		invention to supply the rising demand.
